<h2>sibs - Simple incremental backup script</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    This script is a wrapper around "rsync", and takes backups from one host
    to another. In addition to doing backups, it can also keep track of
    history and changes of files and folders, by doing incremental backups.
    The incremental backups works by hardlinking the files from one folder
    to another:
</p>
<pre>
./incoming          = temporary directory where rsync put its data.
./&lt;interval&gt;.&lt;date&gt; = directory that holds a backup.
                      &lt;date&gt; = [month][date]-[hour][minute]
</pre>
<p>
    Number of incremental backups are controlled by $KEEP_HOUR and $KEEP_DAY.
</p>
<p>
    The backup is stored in this path: $DST_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME/ on $DST_HOST.
    See "CONFIG FILE SAMPLE" later in this script.
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>
$ sibs &lt;man|help&gt;
$ sibs &lt;hour|day|keygen|test&gt; &lt;config-file&gt;
$ sibs &lt;status&gt; &lt;config-file&gt; &lt;path&gt;
$ sibs &lt;config&gt; [config-file]
</pre>
<p>
    Sibs must be initiated on the computer that is taken backup from, and must
    exist in $PATH on the host that is taken backup to.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>help   - this help message.</li>
    <li>man    - the inline manual</li>
    <li>hour   - do backup, with 'hour' interval</li>
    <li>day    - do backup, with 'day' interval</li>
    <li>status - Get changes/deleted status of a file</li>
    <li>keygen - create ssh-sertificates, for automated backups.</li>
    <li>test   - checks config-file and send a test mail.</li>
    <li>config - print either sample config, or content of config-file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Status example</h3>
<pre>
$ sibs status myconfig.env path/to/file
--- Status for file path/to/file
A day.1104-2249 312K
D day.1104-2332 0
A day.1104-2355 350K
- day.1105-0012 350K
M day.1105-0012 310K

"A" = added, "D" = deleted, "M" = modified, "-" = no change.
</pre>
<p>
"path/to/file" is translated into "$DST_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME/path/to/file" on
the remote machine. "path/to/file" cannot contain any form for wildcards.
</p>
<p>
Alternative on remote machine:
<p>
<pre>
$ sibs status /dst_dir/ backup_name path/to/file
</pre>
